To find the subreddit, text
- Array[0][data][children][0][data][subreddit/selftext]
- [author] for author
to find comment reply chains
Array[1][data][children] each of these is a beginning
of a reply 

from each you can check if there is "replies" as a key. If yes, we can do [replies][data][children] again to get a list of replies, and recurse again

[author] is the author
[body] is the text
