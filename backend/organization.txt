Design
A tree that holds a struct that holds
- the author
- the text
- A pointer to the parent struct


The Backend queries and sends a tree to frontend
The frontend displays it, and caches the paths to each node
When the user presses a node, it will send the information of the cached path to the backend, to create a generation
